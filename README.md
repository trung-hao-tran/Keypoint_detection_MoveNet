# MoveNet Keypoint Detection

This project explores the basics of using the MoveNet model for human pose estimation. The goal is to get hands-on experience with MoveNet, a state-of-the-art model for real-time keypoint detection, as part of a self-learning journey.

## Overview

MoveNet is a lightweight and efficient model for detecting keypoints on the human body in images and video streams. This project provides a simple codebase to:

- Load and initialize the MoveNet model.
- Process and display images with keypoint predictions.
- Perform real-time keypoint detection using a webcam.

## Features

- **Keypoint Detection on Images**: Load and visualize keypoints on static images.
- **Real-Time Keypoint Detection**: Capture and process frames from a webcam in real-time.
- **Focus on Self-Learning**: The code is designed to provide a gentle introduction to the MoveNet model and its basic functionalities.

## Future Improvements

- Add more robust error handling and validation.
- Explore advanced keypoint post-processing techniques.
- Integrate the model into applications like fitness tracking or motion analysis.
